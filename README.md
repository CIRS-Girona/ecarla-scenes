<!-- Add badges here -->

This repository contains a synthetic event-based optical flow dataset generated by simulating diverse environments under different weather conditions with the [CARLA]() simulator. An easy-to-use pipeline is also provided for creating custom datasets with optical flow displacements and grayscale images. The dataset is hosted on [Zenodo](), while the data generation pipeline can be used by cloning this repository. The dataset is specifically tailored for autonomous field vehicles, and consists of event streams, grayscale images, and their corresponding ground truth optical flow. All generated data utilizes an optimized format provided within the [eWiz]() framework to facilitate efficient data storage, access, and processing.
